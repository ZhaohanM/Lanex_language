            <hr>
            Licensee may create one account through which Licensee can utilize the Site and Services. Licensee may not
            share Licensee’s account or account information with any other individual. Use of an account by more than
            one individual is strictly prohibited.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Site includes a combination of content that Licensor creates, that Licensor's partners create, and that
            Licensor's users create. Licensee may use the content on the Site only for Licensee’s personal use in
            connection with the Services and/or Licensee’s licensed use of Licensor's products. Except for the
            foregoing, Licensee may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce,
            create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, reverse engineer, publicly display, or in any way

            <br>

            Licensee may be exposed to content that Licensee finds offensive, indecent, or objectionable or that is
            inaccurate, and Licensee bears all risks associated with using that content. Licensor has the right, but not
            the obligation, to remove any content that may, in Licensor's sole discretion, violate this Agreement or
            that is otherwise objectionable.
            <br>
            <br>

            <h5>3. Purpose of Site/Linking</h5>
            <hr>
            The Site is for general informational purposes only. Before you act on information you've found on our
            website, you should independently confirm any facts that are important to your decision. Licensor is not
            responsible for, and cannot guarantee the performance of, any products or services provided by any
            advertisers or others to whose sites we link. A link to another website does not constitute an endorsement
            of that site (nor of any product, service or other material offered on that site) by Licensor or its
            licensors. We welcome links to the homepage of our website. Licensee is free to establish a hypertext link
            to the Site so long as the link does not state or imply any affiliation, connection, sponsorship, or
            approval of your site by Licensor. We do not permit framing or inline linking to our website or any portion
            of it.

            <hr>
            While we make every effort to protect our servers and your data against loss and unauthorized access, you
            acknowledge that the Internet is not a 100% secure environment and thus we cannot guarantee the security of
            your information as there is always a risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our
            security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet may be intercepted. You agree
            that we shall have no responsibility for any losses or damages that do not arise solely from our intentional
            misconduct, including but not limited to losses or damages arising from any third party access of your
            account resulting from theft, misappropriation, or other illegal access of your personal information.

            it accurate, current, and complete. If Licensor issues Licensee a password, Licensee may not reveal it to
            anyone else. Licensee may not use anyone else's password. Licensee is responsible for maintaining the
            confidentiality of Licensee’s account and password. Licensee agrees to immediately notify Licensor of any

            exit from Licensee’s accounts at the end of each session. Licensor will not be responsible for any loss or
            damage that may result if Licensee fails to comply with these requirements.

            copy content and other data from the Site.
            <br> <br>
            If Licensee chooses a username or avatar that, in Licensor's sole discretion, is obscene, indecent, abusive
            or that might otherwise subject Licensor to public disparagement or scorn, Licensor reserves the right,
            without prior notice to Licensee, to automatically change Licensee’s username or avatar, delete Licensee’s
            posts from Licensor's sites, deny Licensee access to Licensor's sites, or any combination of these options.

            accessing the Site. Licensee agrees not to use any automated means, including, without limitation, agents,
            robots, scripts, or spiders, to access, monitor, or copy any part of the Site, except those automated means
            that Licensor has approved in advance in writing.

            authorities.

            <hr>
            Licensee will defend Licensor from any third party claim, and will pay all damages finally awarded against
            Licensor in such claim or amounts agreed to in settlement, arising out of:

            the fault or knowledge of the Licensee;
            The content, the quality, or the performance of content that Licensee submits to the Site; or

            <h5>10. Warranty; Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h5>
            <hr>
            Certain user requests may no longer exist so we cannot guarantee that requests for specific languages will
            be present at all times. We cannot make any promises regarding how our services come to be used, though we
            make our best effort to remain transparent with our users and avoid taking irrational actions which
            compromise users in any way. All we ask is to take caution in using our site as we may not be able to
            recompensate or assist in complex matters.

            <h5>11. Miscelleneous</h5>

            Licensor may be required by state or federal law to notify Licensee of certain events. Licensee hereby
            acknowledges and consents that such notices will be effective upon Licensor's posting them on the Site or
            delivering them to Licensee through e-mail. Licensee may update Licensee’s e-mail address by visiting the
            Services where Licensee has provided contact information. If Licensee does not provide Licensor with
            accurate information, Licensor cannot be held liable if Licensor fails to notify Licensee.
            <br><br>
            Licensor's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a
            waiver of such right or provision. This Agreement and Licensee’s right to use the Services may not be
            assigned by Licensee without the prior written approval of Licensor. Licensor may, at any time in its sole
            discretion, assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any third party without consent from
            or notice to Licensee.
            <br> <br>
            This Agreement, including any applicable attachments, and all terms, conditions, and policies that are
            incorporated into these terms by reference, constitute the entire agreement between Licensee and Licensor
            and govern Licensee’s use of the Site and Services, superseding any prior agreements that Licensee may have
            with Licensor.

            Licensee may not use, import or export materials on this Site in violation of United Kingdom, or any other
            applicable country's, import and export laws and regulations. Licensor assumes no responsibility or
            liability for Licensee’s failure to obtain any necessary export approvals. Without limiting the foregoing,
            Licensee agrees that the Site will not be used, and none of the underlying content, information, software,
            or technology may be transferred or otherwise exported or re-exported to persons subject to restrictions,
            destinations subject to embargo, or to prohibited proliferation-related end-users or end-uses, without
            obtaining any export license or other approval that may be required under United Kingdom, and any other
            applicable country's, laws, regulations and requirements.

            If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, the
            invalid or unenforceable provision will be construed in accordance with applicable law as nearly as possible
